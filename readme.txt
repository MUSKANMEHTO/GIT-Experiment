# GIT & GitHub Experiment ðŸš€

## Objective
To understand the basics of Git and GitHub and set up a GitHub account and repository for version-controlled project management.

## Description
This repository is a practical implementation of my first experiment with version control. I learned how to:
- Initialize a Git repository locally.
- Stage and commit changes.
- Connect my local repo to a remote repository on GitHub.
- Push code to GitHub and manage branches.

## Theory Overview
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for version control and collaboration. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

## Tools Used
- **Git** (for version control)
- **GitHub** (for remote hosting)
- **Visual Studio Code** (as code editor)

## Procedure
1.  Installed Git on my system.
2.  Configured Git with my username and email.
3.  Created a new project folder and initialized Git.
4.  Created sample files (`readme.txt`) and made initial commits.
5.  Created a repository on GitHub and linked it to my local repo.
6.  Pushed the local code to the remote repository.

## Output
Successfully pushed all project files to GitHub and learned the fundamental Git workflow!
